Extension of Database final Project:
A trip planner database was implemented in MySQL, with a command-line controller app implemented in python. 
This repository contains those files, as well as a React-based frontend under construction

TODO:
 - refactor api to feed into context instead of the individual tables
 - handle HTTP errors
 - handle DB fetch errors

PROBLEMS:
 - useHTTP causes missing dependency warning
